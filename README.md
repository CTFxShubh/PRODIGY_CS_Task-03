Password Strength Assessment Tool

This **Password Strength Assessment Tool** is a simple Python program designed to evaluate the strength of passwords based on common security criteria. It assesses passwords against the following requirements:

- Minimum length of 8 characters
- Presence of at least one uppercase letter
- Presence of at least one lowercase letter
- Presence of at least one numeric digit
- Presence of at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:,.<>?/)

The tool provides feedback on the password's strength by evaluating how many of these criteria are met. The feedback ranges from "Very Weak" to "Strong," helping users understand how to create more secure passwords.
